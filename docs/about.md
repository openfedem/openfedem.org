In a Kanban-driven open source project, several roles are typically involved to ensure smooth and efficient project management and development. These roles may vary slightly depending on the specific nature and scale of the project, but generally, they include:

Maintainers/Core Contributors: These are the individuals who have commit access to the project repository. They are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests, managing the release cycle, setting priorities, and maintaining the overall health of the project. In open source projects, maintainers often originate as active contributors who have demonstrated a deep understanding of the project and its goals.

Contributors: Contributors are anyone who contributes to the project. This could be in the form of code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, or any other form of contribution that helps the project. In open-source projects, contributors can range from one-time contributors to regular participants.

Project Manager/Lead: In some open source projects, especially larger ones, there might be an individual or a group of individuals acting as project managers or leads. They oversee the project's progress, coordinate tasks, ensure that the workflow aligns with Kanban principles (like limiting work in progress), and facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.

Community Manager: For projects with a large user base, a community manager plays a crucial role in engaging with the community, handling outreach, managing forums or chat platforms, and gathering feedback from users. They often act as a bridge between the users and the development team.

Testers/QA Contributors: Quality Assurance (QA) is vital in any software project. In open source projects, this role can be filled by dedicated testers or by contributors who focus on writing and maintaining tests, performing manual testing, and reporting bugs and issues.

Documentation Writers: Good documentation is crucial for open source projects. This role involves creating and maintaining clear, comprehensive documentation for the project, including setup instructions, user guides, and API documentation.

Designers: For projects with a graphical user interface, designers are important. They work on the design aspects of the project, including UI/UX design, graphics, and user interaction.

DevOps/SysAdmins: In projects that require continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, server management, or other infrastructure needs, individuals with skills in DevOps or system administration play a key role.

Product Owners/Stakeholders: In some projects, especially those backed by organizations, there might be product owners or stakeholders who define the vision and requirements of the project and prioritize tasks in the backlog.

Kanban in open source projects is less about strict role definitions and more about the fluid contribution of different skills as needed. Roles can overlap, and contributors often wear multiple hats depending on the project's needs and their skill sets. The key principle of Kanban is to improve efficiency and adaptability by visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and continuously improving the workflow, all of which can be achieved regardless of the formal structure of the team.
